## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose of The Project Quality Management Plan

The Project Quality Management Plan documents the necessary information required to effectively manage project quality from project planning to delivery. It defines a projectâ€™s quality policies, procedures, criteria for and areas of application, and roles, responsibilities and authorities.The Project Quality Management Plan is created during the Planning Phase of the project. Its intended audience is the project manager, project team, project sponsor and any senior leaders whose support is needed to carry out the plan.

## 3 PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT

At the highest of levels Quality Management involves planning, doing, checking, and acting to improve project quality standards. PMI PMBOK breaks the practice of Quality Management into three process groups: Quality Planning (QP), Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC). The following sections define how this project will apply each of these practice groups to define, monitor and control quality standards.

### 3.1 Quality Planning

#### 3.1.1 Define Project Quality

Quality Standards and Expectations:
- Adherence to ISO 9001:2015 standards for quality management systems.
- Compliance with local and national regulations regarding safety, privacy (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and fair trade practices.
- Expectations of customer satisfaction based on NPS (Net Promoter Score) benchmarks for service platforms.
Customer and Project Goals:
- Customer goal: Seamless connection to skilled tradespeople with transparent pricing and timely service delivery.
- Project goal: Ensure platform stability, secure transactions, and user-friendly interfaces.

#### 3.1.2 Measure Project Quality
Desired Metrics and Monitoring Processes:
- Customer Satisfaction: Monthly NPS surveys and feedback forms.
- Platform Performance: Daily monitoring of uptime and page load times using tools like Google Lighthouse or New Relic.
- Tradesperson Quality: Monthly audits of user reviews and service ratings (>4.0 stars).

Plan for Measuring Quality:
- Bi-weekly review of key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Establish a cross-functional QA team to oversee and validate processes.

Methods of Data Collection and Archiving:
- Automated logging of platform performance metrics using cloud monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).
- Customer feedback stored securely in a database for analysis and reporting.

Timeframe for Measurement and Metrics Reporting:
- Weekly: Internal metrics updates to the QA team.
- Monthly: Quality performance reports shared with stakeholders.
- Quarterly: Comprehensive quality assurance reviews and public updates.

### 3.2 Quality Assurance

#### 3.2.1 Analyze Project Quality

Analyze Quality Data:
- Use data visualization tools like Tableau to identify trends in customer complaints, system downtimes, and defect rates.
- Regularly benchmark against industry standards for platform and service quality.

Document Opportunities for Improvement:
- Highlight recurring pain points (e.g., platform crashes during peak hours).
- Implement corrective action plans, such as increased server capacity or improved onboarding guides for tradespeople.

Eliminate Gaps Between Current and Desired Levels:
- Address the root causes of identified gaps through retrospectives, user interviews, and failure mode analysis.

#### 3.2.2 Improve Project Quality

Identify Improvements:
- Introduce automated testing for faster, more reliable QA processes.
- Streamline user interfaces to improve navigation based on heatmap data.

Eliminate Unsatisfactory Performance:
- Partner with professional training providers to upskill tradespeople flagged in low-quality service reports.
- Introduce a stricter vetting process for tradespeople joining the platform.

### 3.3 Quality Control

Monitoring and Controlling Actions:
- Conduct periodic inspections and testing of deliverables against acceptance criteria.
- Use control charts and statistical process control (SPC) to monitor quality trends in real-time.
- Implement peer reviews for project deliverables and documentation.

Determination of Compliance:
- Match deliverables against quality standards outlined in the planning document.
- Validate through rigorous acceptance testing and stakeholder approval.

Ownership of Ongoing Monitoring and Improvement:
- Assign quality managers and process owners to oversee specific aspects of the project.
- Establish a continuous improvement team to monitor, analyze, and address quality metrics regularly.
- Quality Manager: Responsible for audits, compliance, and corrective actions.
- Process Owners: Oversee specific project phases, ensuring adherence to quality standards.
- Continuous Improvement Team: Focus on identifying and implementing improvements across the project lifecycle.
